# htpc_install

This script will harshly install the following packages:

    * HTPC Manager
    * Plex
    * Sonarr/NZBDrone
    * CouchPotato
    * NZBGet
    * Apache

I plan to add logic later to do some fact checking and error handling within the installs.
For now I am just following guides from http://www.htpcguides.com
